title: UFC end of fight analysis

Analysis of how every fight in UFC from 1993 to 2016 has ended, a question of point decision, most common fight ending techniques, and more. 

What variable has the most effect on how a fight ends? 

Since each fighter is often affiliated with multiple associations, and fights in several weight classes, it made the most sense to work with individual fighters, especially with hard to account for variables like bone density, muscle recruitment, reaction time, etc. So many variables among atheletes are very fine tuned to individuals.

That being said, 40% Of all fights in UFC end with a uninimous decision, which makes sense given how nearly equally matched UFC fighters tend to be in skill level and size. Following behind a unanimous decision, punch combos are the most common at 25%, even more than other judge decisions. Submission techniques beat out most other strikes for frequency in ending a fight at 13%, especially kicks and knees, but still make up a minority compared to strikes overall. 

Given the variations in strategies used by different fighters, it might be worth looking at this distribution of techniques with each different fighter. More likely than not, distributions for the best fighters will look much different, but how is hard to say. I would have guessed knockouts would be more common for them as skill level increased.

The average fight outcomes for the top ten UFC fighters:


After looking at top ten fighters with the most wins in UFC(not specifying championship fights), George St. Pierre is the highest in the dataset in terms of most wins of any fighter in the UFC.

What's his finishing rate compared to others?

As we can see, Georges St. Pierre is 12% more likely to end his fights with a Unanimous decision than other fighters. This might be because he's a more defensive fighter, and primarily uses strikes. This could be because of his reach advantage, or because he has a background in karate, which is generally more defensive than other styles. It's interesting this trend of Unanimous preference is nearly universal regardless, but increases with skill level.
