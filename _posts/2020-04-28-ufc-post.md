Analysis of how every fight in UFC from 1993 to 2016 has ended, a question of point decision, most common fight ending techniques, and more.

32% Of all fights in UFC end with a uninimous decision, which makes sense given how nearly equally matched UFC fighters tend to be in skill level and size. Following behind a unanimous decision, punch combos are the most common, even more than other judge decisions. Submission techniques beat out most strikes for frequency in ending a fight, but still make up a minority compared to strikes comunulatively. 

There are two fairly large factors that might affect how a fight ends, those being how easy a technique is to use at different weight classes, and the associations that those fighters trained at.

There's a fairly even distribution of weight classes until we get to flyweight, straw weight, super heavyweight, and atomweight. That's because these classes are either gender specific (like atomweight), or were removed from UFC (super heavyweight). Very few fighters meet these extremes, and classes like atomweight (95 pounds and under) are seemingly nonexistent.
